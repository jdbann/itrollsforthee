I want to improve myself as a Dungeon Master. Every time I run a session, I can see an abundance of issues I need to address and an ocean of opportunities I have to make the game better. It's overwhelming, and it's exhausting.

For about 60% of my sessions, I have the mental energy and the emotional wherewithal to take risks and try new things---to push myself. The other 40% I feel raw, I want the players to do more of the work than me, and I beat myself up because there is much more I should be doing in the game.

Running a game like Dungeons & Dragons is a big and complicated skill. Trying to vaguely 'become better' at it is a recipe for stress. Breaking that skill down into smaller areas of focus helps measure smaller but more meaningful wins. Mike Shea ([Sly Flourish](https://slyflourish.com)) has done that.

In his [Paths for DM Expertise](https://slyflourish.com/path_for_dm_expertise.html) article, he outlines the broader strokes of a Dungeon Master's progression. It has helped me orient myself, and drawn my attention to a specific area of improvement.

From my own self-assessment, I'm around the "Becoming the Characters' Biggest Fan" stage. I'm finding this difficult in my current campaign; I don't have any clear understanding of any of my players' characters and I struggle to make them the centre of the story as a result.

Mike's advice in the article is to:

> Make reviewing the characters the [first step in our game prep](https://slyflourish.com/returnofthelazydm/index.html) [and to] run [session zeros](https://slyflourish.com/dragon_heist_session_zero.html) to calibrate everyone's expectations of a campaign.

Another helpful flourish is the recommended reading for each section, in this case it's [Dungeon World](https://dungeon-world.com). I look forward to it! [^And it's incredibly helpful to get a specific reading tip as I'm struggling to prioritise my backlog of greedily acquired rulebooks for various systems.]

Mike's article helps further by reminding me that it is all a journey. The core rulebooks do not appear as recommended reading until we've tackled improvisation, pacing and props. What a huge relief!

I can stop forcing myself to read through the Dungeon Master's Guide, getting excited (but overwhelmed) with ways to run complicate chase encounters or add sanity as an extra attribute.

Instead I'm reminded to focus on enjoying the game and playing it more. Thank you, Mike!
